Thanks to 4D for providing the [dot notation](https://developer.4d.com/docs/en/Concepts/object.html#object-properties) and the [**Formula**](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv18/4D/18/Formula.301-4505749.en.html) command. This makes it possible to use class programming in 4D to make the code more readable and intuitive.

Here is my thoughts and the results of my experiences around these incredible novelties. 

For several years, my motivation has been to simplify code writing. The recent arrival of new functionalities of the language of 4D led me to the results that I give you in this project.

This is not a "how do I" or a recommendation, but a work in progress way that may interest some developers to explore. If this is the case,  your contributions or comments will be welcome.
